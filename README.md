#### Installation:
 
You can check my version here: 

Fork this to your computer. You will have to install MongoDB Compass, create a cluster, and note the URI and password. In the dal-api.js file in the back-end folder, replace the URL on line 3 with yours. Make sure you replace the placeholder with your password. Then in the backend folder, you use "npm start" in the terminal. Then, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000 Now, you will go into the front-end folder and run "npm start" in the terminal. You will then be able to navigate to the backend folder and run "npm start" in the terminal http://localhost:3030 will run the backend. You will also be able to view in Mongo Atlas.
 
#### Usage:
 
You can use the the app to organize and pick your board game for the next game night. You can add, delete (TODO), and edit (TODO) individual games. You can view your entire game library.
 
#### Support:

#### Roadmap: 
I'd like the website to allow multiple users with different libraries. I would like to add OAuth next, so users could choose to login with email or with a token. I would like to allow a read only library list for friends to plan Game Nights or to decide what game you need as a gift.
